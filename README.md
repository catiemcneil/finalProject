Project Description

Podcast roulette will be a sort of Pandora for podcasts - helping users discover and listen to podcasts.

At it's most basic implementation, users will click a button and a podcast episode will be displayed. There will be restrictions in place to prevent the same podcast from appearing more than once every 200 clicks, and only the most recent episode will be chosen. Users will be able to navigate to the host page of that podcast to continue to listen to more episodes if they so choose. The user may click the button an unlimited number of times, at any point, to find a new/different podcast.

There will also be a user authenication piece to this project. Users may sign up and login. Once logged in, a user can save podcasts to their personal playlist page. They may also upvote or downvote podcasts while they are playing. Up and down votes are intended as a public rating system, so an downvote will not automatically change to a new podcast.

UI description

Ideally the UI will be rather simple: A description telling the user to click the button to find a random podcast, a button accompanied by an animation that will spin when the button is clicked. The podcast will appear under the spinner and button. At the top of the page on the navigation bar, the user will be able to sign up, login, and navigate to a page with saved podcasts.
